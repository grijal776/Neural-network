CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This program demonstrates how to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The program consists of the following steps:

Import the necessary libraries
Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
Preprocess the data
Build and compile the CNN model
Train the model on the training data
Evaluate the model on the testing data
Save the trained model to a file
Load the trained model from the file
Use the trained model to classify new images
To run the program, open the Jupyter notebook file cnn_cifar10.ipynb in Google Colaboratory and follow the instructions in the notebook. The notebook contains code cells for each step of the program, as well as explanations and comments to guide you through the process.

The program requires the following libraries to be installed:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
The program also requires an internet connection to download the CIFAR-10 dataset and to load images from URLs.
